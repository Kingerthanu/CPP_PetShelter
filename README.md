# CPP_PetShelter
  A functioning Binary Search Tree which contains most functions expressed in its ADT. Allowing for balance checks, size checks on levels, as well as on the whole tree. It also has removal, insertion, and search of animal pets contained by each node. It has in-order, post-order, and pre-order traversals as well and can find its parent node. 
This Program Utilizes Custom Made Prioirity Queues In Which Show The Latest Adoptee Pets In The Shelter As Well As Gives Us The Ability To Add New Pets To The Shelter. This Works To Make A Useful Object In Which Can Utilize Animal Data To Display To The User Preferred Data Like Newest, Youngest, Etc.

  The main focus of this assignment is to display firm knowledge of the data type and its interface and how it can be implemented and how its invariants associated with its data type are handled in varying functions. This assignment also teaches about public interfaces to private member-tampering functions. This also greatly helped my understanding of unit tests and how to properly maintain and analyze personal code for errors and "silent" bugs.

This Taught Me A Lot About Data Structures And The Power Of Some Of These In Accelerating Data Manipulation In Large Chained Structs. It Also Shows How "Easy" A Problem Can Be Solved In Code As This Works As A Powerful Structure To Be Used In Shelters In The Real World (Of Course To A Extent / Generally Speaking) Which Is Cool.
