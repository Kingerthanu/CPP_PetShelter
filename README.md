  The main focus of this assignment is to display firm knowledge of the data type and its interface and how it can be implemented and how its invariants associated with its data type are handled in varying functions. This assignment also teaches about public interfaces to private member-tampering functions. This also greatly helped my understanding of unit tests and how to properly maintain and analyze personal code for errors and "silent" bugs.
